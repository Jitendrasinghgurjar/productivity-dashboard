# Productivity Dashboard 🧠📊

This is a *Productivity Dashboard* project I built as part of the *Sheryians Coding School - Job Ready AI Powered Cohort*.  
The main goal was to understand how to build a dashboard layout from scratch using *HTML, CSS, and practice **JavaScript DOM manipulation* to handle user interactions without any frameworks.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Clean and modern UI design
- ✅ Daily Task Tracker section
- ✅ Buttons with dynamic behavior using JavaScript
- ✅ DOM-based interactivity (add/delete tasks, status changes)
- ✅ Well-structured project folder and clean code

> ⚠ Note: This version is currently not responsive on mobile or tablets. A responsive version is planned in the next update.

## 📚 What I Learned
- Building structured layouts using semantic HTML
- Styling UI using CSS (Flexbox, spacing, colors)
- Manipulating the DOM using JavaScript
- Handling events like button clicks dynamically
- Organizing files and writing modular code
